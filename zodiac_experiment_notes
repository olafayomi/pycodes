1.) Do interVLAN routing on a zodiac switch and make it completely transparent 
    to the end devices connected to the ports.
    - Eth0 is a VLAN trunk port, allow certain VLANs through, send others
      to the controller.
    - The rest of the ports should allow traffic from any of the whitelisted VLANs
      and it should be transparent to the end devices connected to these ports, i.e
      there should be flow rules that strip packets that will be forward out of these
      interfaces of VLANs and append VLAN tags to incoming packets received on these
      interfaces so that they can be forwarded out the right port.
    - This might be the most important -- Implement InterVLAN routing on an OpenFlow
      switch with a OpenFlow Controller.
    - Add policy based routing and application specific route selection to the controller.
